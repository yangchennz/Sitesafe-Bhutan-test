       <h4> Why SiteSafe Bhutan?</h4>
       <br>

      <P> Every year over 80% of accidents and injuries in Bhutan are from construction and industrial estates as stipulated by Kuensel. The nature of the construction jobs is prone to accidents but with no proper structure of safety measures and tools in place, lots of avoidable accidents are occurred and its impact on society.
Sitesafe Bhutan aims to collaborate with government organisation to keep both the parties (employers and employees) on same page about the importance of health and safety on site. Change the mind set of employees that their safety is responsibility of their authorities but in reality “Safety Starts from Us.” And also, employers to provide proper safety gears such as hard hat, footwear, gloves, face shields etc. and regular monitoring to prevent negligence. Together we can create safe place for us and save lives.
Let’s remember “Safety Starts from Me”
