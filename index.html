     <b>Why health and safety are important in the construction industry?</b>
     </P>
     <p>The construction industry is one of the more hazardous workplaces, but the vast majority of its associated risks can
     be avoided with proper health and safety measures.<br>Health and safety processes play a vital role in minimising the number
     of risks on a construction site and, as such, they should be implemented from the start.
    </p>
    <p>
     The relevant health and safety measures on any construction site, as well as how workers, passers by and the business itself,
     can be affected without these processes in place.Having a planned approach to health and safety helps you manage risks that could
     lead to illnesses, injuries or even death.

   <b>Protect the wellbeing of passerby</b>
    <p>
     The responsibility of construction managers doesn’t end at protecting their workforce – it’s their job to protect the wellbeing of any members of the public passing by the construction site.</p>
     <p>When health and safety measures haven’t been introduced to a construction site, there are a whole host of dangers that can occur, as we have discussed already in the post.</p>
     <p>These dangers can affect passersby almost as easily as they can the team on the construction site, which is another reason for why it’s vital that proper measures are not only put in place,
    but are followed by everyone on the site.</p>
